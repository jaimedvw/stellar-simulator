# `Transaction` Class Documentation  

## Overview  

The `Transaction` class represents a single transaction in the simulation. It includes a unique identifier (hash) and a timestamp to track when the transaction was created. The class is designed to be lightweight and hashable, making it suitable for use in sets or as dictionary keys.  

---

## Constructor  

### `__init__(self, time=None)`  
Initializes a new `Transaction` object.  

#### Parameters:  
- `time` (optional): A custom timestamp for the transaction. If not provided, the current system time is used.  

#### Behavior:  
- Generates a unique 32-bit hash for the transaction.  
- Records the timestamp when the transaction is created (or the provided `time`).  

#### Logging:  
Logs the creation of the transaction with its hash and timestamp.  

#### Example:  
```python
from time import time

# Create a transaction with the current time
transaction1 = Transaction()

# Create a transaction with a custom timestamp
transaction2 = Transaction(time=time())
```

---

## Properties  

### `hash`  
- **Description**: Returns the unique hash of the transaction.  
- **Type**: `str`  

#### Example:  
```python
print(transaction1.hash)
# Output: 'a1b2c3d4' (example hash)
```

---

## Methods  

### `__repr__(self)`  
Returns a string representation of the `Transaction` object, including its hash and timestamp.  

#### Example:  
```python
print(transaction1)
# Output: [Transaction a1b2c3d4 time = 1672534567.1234]
```

---

### `__hash__(self)`  
Generates a hash for the `Transaction` object, allowing it to be used in hash-based collections like sets or as dictionary keys.  

#### Example:  
```python
transaction_set = {transaction1, transaction2}
print(transaction_set)
# Output: {[Transaction a1b2c3d4 time = 1672534567.1234], [Transaction e5f6g7h8 time = 1672534578.5678]}
```

---

## Use Cases  

1. **Creating Unique Transactions**  
   Generate and track unique transactions with associated timestamps.  
   ```python
   tx = Transaction()
   ```

2. **Using Transactions in Sets or as Dictionary Keys**  
   Store transactions in a `set` or use them as keys in a dictionary for fast lookups and comparisons.  
   ```python
   transaction_map = {transaction1: "Processed", transaction2: "Pending"}
   print(transaction_map[transaction1])  # Output: Processed
   ```

3. **Simulation Logging**  
   Leverage the logging functionality to track transaction creation and timestamp details for debugging and analysis.  

---

## Key Features  

- **Hashing Support**: Each `Transaction` object is hashable and can be used in collections that require unique elements.  
- **Logging**: Automatically logs details about created transactions, aiding in debugging and tracking.  
- **Customizable Timestamp**: Allows flexibility in defining transaction creation time.
